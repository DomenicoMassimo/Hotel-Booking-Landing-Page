# Hotel-Booking-Landing-Page
I am proceeding with the creation of the page in graphic order from top to bottom.
I tend to use flexbox.
At the top of the CSS file are the main style rules.
For the main structure of the body I am following the organization and nomenclature of the mockup.

body <br>
header <br>
main <br>
section title" <br>
section booking <br>
section package-summery <br>
section other packages <br>
section guest review <br>
section newsletter <br>
section other activities <br>

footer
